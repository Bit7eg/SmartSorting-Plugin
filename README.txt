== Description ==

Smart sorting is an easy way to increase sales and user experience.
With any set of products in your online store, it is important to show the user first of all those products that they are most likely to buy. 
To do this, our plugin collects information about the number of views and sales of each product and re-sorts the products in your store using a simple formula for sales per views.

== Getting Started ==

= Minimum Requirements =

* Latest release versions of WordPress and WooCommerce ([read more here](https://developer.woocommerce.com/?p=9998))
* PHP version 7.0 or greater (PHP 7.4 or greater is recommended)
* MySQL version 5.6 or greater

Visit the [WooCommerce server requirements documentation](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/server-requirements/) for a detailed list of server requirements.

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of this plugin, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type “WooCommerce Blocks” and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found this plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading the plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).
